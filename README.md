# solid-happiness

### This is a project for a game where you collect happy faces to trade for misson matierials.
Missons are where people around the village ask or challenge you to do things for a reward.  
Rewards are greater the harder the misson is, so for example, it could be as simple as playing a certian minigame a lot, or as difficult as making a vast map.
